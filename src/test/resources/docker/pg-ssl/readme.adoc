## SSL certificates from PostgreSQL

It's certificates from https://github.com/CjS77/docker-postgres-cert
It's used to configure pgsql-client to verify thous cert.

@Mart-Bogdan tried to allow binging custom certificate, so Docker would read from this folder, but that's
  impossible on Windows OS without special magic.
